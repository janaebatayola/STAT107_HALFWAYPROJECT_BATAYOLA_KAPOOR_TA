NBA Win Predictor Using Multivariable Regression Analysis

## Overview
This project investigates which game statistics are the most significant predictors of winning an NBA game.  
Using team-level game data, we apply multivariable logistic regression to model the binary outcome (`win = 1` or `0`) based on statistics such as rebounds, scoring efficiency, and turnovers. Other contextual effects included are home/away games and days of rest prior to the game.
